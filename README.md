<h1> David Fac√≥'s Pong </h1>

Well, there is absolutely nothing different here compared to your average pong, but the project itself was a huge study in physics and good pratices using **Object Oriented Programming**. The game is played agains a rudimentary IA controlled via position comparations when the ball is flying towards it. To not make the game impossible to win, the IA will try to just stay on center when the ball is not going towards it, only tracking it when necessary. There is a script in the second paddle to allow a second player to join. overral, it was a pretty fun study that took me a whole night to create.

**PS:** I didn't use encapsulation to facilitate the object assignment proccess and save myself some lines of code. Please forgive me :')
